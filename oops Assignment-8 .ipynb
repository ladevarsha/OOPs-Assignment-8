    "5.What is inheritance? Give an example for each type of inheritance.\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "     Inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming(OOP)that allows creating a new class(child class) based on an existing class(parent class).\n",
    "     Inheritance provides a way to reuse code and allows creating new classes that are related to existing classes.\n",
    "     This makes easier maintain and extend the code and reduces the amount of redundant code.\n",

    "     Their are 5 types of inheritance\n",

    "        1.Single inheritance--> A child class inherits properties and                                    methods from a single parent class.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        2.multi-level inheritance--> A child class inherits from a                                            parent class, and the parent class                                      inherits from a grandparent class.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        3.Multiple inheritance--> A child class inherits properties and                                   methods from multiple parent classes.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        4.Hierarchical inheritance--> Multiple child classes inherits                                         from a single parent class.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        5.Hybrid inheritance--> It is a combination of multiple                                         inheritance and other inheritance types.\n",
